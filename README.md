Verified Roommate & Flatmate Matching Platform

Project Overview
Living Together is an Android-based mobile application designed to help users find compatible roommates and shared living spaces in a safe, reliable, and efficient way. The platform focuses on solving common problems in shared living, such as lack of proper room listings, trust issues, and difficulty finding suitable roommates.
Unlike informal platforms, the application provides a structured system for profile creation, preference matching, and secure communication.



Objectives
To provide a reliable platform for finding roommates and shared rooms
To reduce dependency on unstructured and unreliable platforms
To enable users to match based on preferences such as location, budget, and lifestyle
To promote safer and more organized shared living
